                    I am a passionate MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack developer with a passion for coding and problem solving. I have solved over 500 problems on coding platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, and Leetcode which has honed my skills. Recently completed my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering in April 2023.

                    My goal is to establish myself as a successful software developer. I love using my solid grasp of full-stack JavaScript development to create high quality web applications. Continuous learning through taking on programming challenges excites me, as I can constantly upgrade my skills in this fast moving industry. I hope to apply my technical knowledge and solving-complex-problems mindset to build both robust and user-friendly web apps.
